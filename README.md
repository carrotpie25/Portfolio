# Portfolio

Hii, I'm Michelle (Avery) Basarah and welcome to my project gallery as a Data Science student. This portfolio is a collection of the works I have done for academic purposes, as well as for personal projects.  

## My Projects
* [N Queen Problem (C++)](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/6d79ad682cb6256568c0f87cfab30217cac1406e/NQueen%20Problem) </br>
  The N Queens problem entails the placement of N chess queens on a chessboard in a way that no two queens attack each other, using the recursive backtracking algorithm. </br>
* [Database: Airline booking DBMS (Oracle)](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/c051cec424986f3f2f138bb0ec9917a3ec97d38f/Airline%20Booking%20System%20DBMS) </br>
   Creating simple database management system for an airline company, allowing keep track of passenger’s and staff’s details, ticket prices, flight schedules,  transactions, etc. With so much data and details. An airline database system allows customers to retrieve information from database and update it automatically without the hassle and manual labor. </br>
* [Database: School Login Management System](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/51322914f259bae84e96a073f64d71bcf41253af/School%20login%20management%20system)<br>
  Creating simple school login management system to manage user authentication and access control for a school environment. It allows students, teachers, and administrators to log in using their credentials and access relevant modules, such as course information or administrative tools 
* [CNN Image classification](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/9e3c8d67756067507909e51a45e169e1f8112279/Image%20Classification)</br>
  Image classification programming using the convolutional neural network (CNN)
* [Database Normalization with Covid 19 data](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/2b4b1951083f6aabe85e18bb824146a8361162a9/Covid%2019%20Data%20Normalization)<br>
Cleaning and normalizing a given raw COVID-19 data and normalizing it into 3NF. The project includes writing SQL queries to perform tasks such as data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis, as well as visualizing the outputs. <br>
*   [Pattern Recognition: Covid-19 CT Image Data Classification Using PCA and three types of classifiers: KNN,  Naive Bayes and MLP-NN](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/c7a373ac308dc877f1f677ee76dba9b642776b5e/Covid-19%20CT%20Image%20PCA%20Classification) </br>
    Comparing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks for Covid-19 CT Image Data Classification Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
