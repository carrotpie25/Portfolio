# Portfolio

Hii, welcome to my project gallery as a Data Science student. 

## My Projects
* [N Queen Problem (C++)](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/6d79ad682cb6256568c0f87cfab30217cac1406e/NQueen%20Problem) </br>
  The N Queens problem entails the placement of N chess queens on a chessboard in a way that no two queens attack each other, using the recursive backtracking algorithm. </br>
* [Airline booking DBMS (Oracle)](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/c051cec424986f3f2f138bb0ec9917a3ec97d38f/Airline%20Booking%20System%20DBMS) </br>
   Airline booking system is the database management system for an airline company. It allows the company to keep track of passenger’s and staff’s details, ticket prices, flight schedules,  transactions, etc. With so much data and details, airline booking management system helps company to manage and keep track of the data through automation by database. An airline database system allows customers to retrieve information from database and update it automatically without the hassle and manual labor. </br>
* [CNN Image classification](https://github.com/carrotpie25/Portfolio/tree/9e3c8d67756067507909e51a45e169e1f8112279/Image%20Classification)</br>
  Simple image classification program using the convolutional neural network (CNN)
* [Random Forest for Financial Risk Management]
*   Covid-19 CT Image Data Classification Using PCA and three types of classifiers: KNN,  Naive Bayes and MLP-NN </br>
    Comparing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks for Covid-19 CT Image Data Classification Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
